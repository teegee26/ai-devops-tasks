1. **Use Minimal Base Images:**  
    Start with lightweight images (like `alpine`) to reduce vulnerabilities and attack surface.

2. **Run Containers as Non-Root Users:**  
    Configure your Dockerfile and containers to run processes as a non-root user.

3. **Keep Images Updated:**  
    Regularly update base images and dependencies to include the latest security patches.

4. **Limit Container Capabilities:**  
    Use Docker security options (like `--cap-drop` and `--read-only`) to restrict container privileges.

5. **Scan Images for Vulnerabilities:**  
    Integrate automated image scanning tools (such as Trivy or Clair) into your CI/CD pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities.



    **How to Implement Minimal Base Images:**

    - **In your `Dockerfile`:**  
        Use a minimal base image such as `alpine` by specifying it in the `FROM` statement. For example:
        ```dockerfile
        FROM python:3.11-alpine
        # or
        FROM node:20-alpine
        ```

    - **In your `docker-compose.yml`:**  
        Reference your Dockerfile or use an official minimal image directly:
        ```yaml
        services:
            app:
                build:
                    context: .
                    dockerfile: Dockerfile
                # or use an image directly
                image: node:20-alpine
        ```

    Using minimal images reduces the overall size and potential vulnerabilities in your containers.
