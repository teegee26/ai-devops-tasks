timgio26: how to use this file

GitHub.copilot-chat.github.copilot.editor: This file is a [Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin) YAML file. It allows you to configure Jenkins automatically, including system settings, tools, plugins, and jobs, without manual setup in the Jenkins UI.

**How to use this file:**

1. **Install Jenkins and the Configuration as Code Plugin**
   - Make sure Jenkins is installed.
   - Install the `configuration-as-code` plugin (can be done via the Jenkins UI or by including it in your Docker image).

2. **Place the YAML File**
   - Save your YAML file (e.g., as jenkins-casc.yaml).
   - Place it where Jenkins can access it, such as jenkins-casc.yaml if using Docker.

3. **Configure Jenkins to Use the File**
   - Set the environment variable `CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG` to the path of your YAML file.
   - Example for Docker:
     ````bash
     docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
       -v /your/path/jenkins-casc.yaml:/var/jenkins_home/jenkins-casc.yaml \
       -e CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG=/var/jenkins_home/jenkins-casc.yaml \
       jenkins/jenkins:lts
     ````
   - For non-Docker setups, set the environment variable before starting Jenkins.

4. **Start Jenkins**
   - Jenkins will read the YAML file on startup and configure itself accordingly.

**Gotchas:**
- The plugins listed under `plugins: required:` must be available for installation.
- If you change the YAML, restart Jenkins to apply changes.
- Syntax errors in the YAML can prevent Jenkins from starting correctlyâ€”validate your YAML before use.

**Summary:**  
Place the file where Jenkins can read it, set the `CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG` environment variable to its path, and start Jenkins. The system will auto-configure itself as described in the YAML.
