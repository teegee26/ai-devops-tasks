## Why ignore these files?

Ignoring these files in version control (e.g., using `.gitignore`) is important for several reasons:

- **Node.js dependencies** (`node_modules/`, lock files): These are large, auto-generated directories and files that can be restored using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Storing them bloats the repository and can cause conflicts.
- **Environment variables** (`.env`): These files often contain sensitive information (API keys, passwords) that should not be shared or exposed publicly.
- **Logs** (`logs/`, `*.log`): Log files are generated during development and runtime, and are not needed in source control.
- **OS files** (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`): These are system-specific files created by operating systems and have no relevance to the project.
- **Docker files** (override files, `.docker/`, `*.pid`): Local Docker configuration and process ID files are environment-specific and should not be shared.
- **MongoDB data** (`/data/db/`, `mongodb/`, `*.mongodb`): Database files are large, binary, and environment-specific.
- **VSCode settings** (`.vscode/`): Editor settings are often user-specific and not relevant to all contributors.
- **Coverage reports** (`coverage/`, `.nyc_output/`): Test coverage outputs are generated during testing and should not be tracked.

Ignoring these files keeps the repository clean, secure, and easier to collaborate on.
