### Error Explanation

You are seeing this error because port `3000` on your host machine is already in use by another process. Docker cannot bind your container's port to a host port that is already occupied.

#### How to Fix

- **Stop the process using port 3000:**  
    Find and stop the process currently using port 3000, or

- **Change the port mapping:**  
    Edit your `docker-compose.yml` or Docker run command to use a different host port, e.g. `- "3001:3000"`.

#### Example (`docker-compose.yml`):

```yaml
services:
    app:
        ports:
            - "3001:3000"
```

Check which process is using port 3000 (on Linux/macOS):

```sh
lsof -i :3000
```

On Windows, use:

```sh
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```
This error message means that Docker tried to start your `app` service and map port `3000` from the container to port `3000` on your host machine, but the host port is already being used by another application. As a result, Docker cannot bind to that port and the container fails to start.

To resolve this, either stop the process currently using port `3000` on your host, or change the port mapping in your Docker configuration to use a different available port on the host (such as `3001:3000`).
